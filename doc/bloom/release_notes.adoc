== Boost 1.90

* Added bulk-mode insertion and lookup for increased performance.
* Made lookup implementation branchless for `block`, `fast_multiblock32`
and `fast_multiblock64`, which results in some performance gains, particularly
for mixed successful/unsuccessful queries.

== Boost 1.89

* Initial release.
