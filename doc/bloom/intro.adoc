Boost.Bloom provides the class template `xref:tutorial[boost::bloom::filter]`
that can be configured to implement a classical Bloom filter as well as
variations discussed in the literature such as block filters, multiblock filters,
and more.

#include <boost/bloom/filter.hpp>
#include <cassert>
#include <string>

int main()
{
  // Bloom filter of strings with 5 bits set per insertion
  using filter = boost::bloom::filter<std::string, 5>;

  // create filter with a capacity of 1'000'000 **bits**
  filter f(1'000'000);

  // insert elements (they can't be erased, Bloom filters are insert-only)
  f.insert("hello");
  f.insert("Boost");
  //...

  // elements inserted are always correctly checked as such
  assert(f.may_contain("hello") == true);

  // elements not inserted may incorrectly be identified as such with a
  // false positive rate (FPR) which is a function of the array capacity,
  // the number of bits set per element and generally how the boost::bloom::filter
  // was specified
  if(f.may_contain("bye")) { // likely false
    //...
  }
}

The different filter variations supported are specified at compile time
as part of the `boost::bloom::filter` instantiation definition.
Boost.Bloom has been implemented with a focus on performance;
SIMD technologies such as AVX2, Neon and SSE2 can be leveraged to speed up
operations.

Boost.Bloom is a header-only library. C++11 or later required.
